1. Definition of Attribute in the Context of a Database:
In a database, an attribute refers to a characteristic or property of an entity. It represents a specific piece of information that describes an aspect of the entity being modeled. Attributes are the building blocks of database tables, where each attribute corresponds to a column in the table.
2. Importance of a Unique Identifier in a Database:
Having a unique identifier for each item in a database is crucial for several reasons:
It ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate entries.
It facilitates efficient data retrieval and manipulation, as each item can be uniquely identified.
It enables relationships and associations between different entities in the database.
It supports data consistency and accuracy, especially in relational databases where entities are linked through foreign keys.
It simplifies data management and maintenance tasks, such as updates and deletions.

5. Difference Between Single-Valued and Multi-Valued Attributes:
Single-Valued Attribute: A single-valued attribute holds only one value for each instance of an entity. For example, in a "Student" entity, the attribute "Age" would typically be single-valued because a student typically has only one age at any given time.
Multi-Valued Attribute: A multi-valued attribute can hold multiple values for each instance of an entity. For example, in a "Student" entity, the attribute "Phone Number" could be multi-valued because a student may have multiple phone numbers (e.g., home, mobile, work)
